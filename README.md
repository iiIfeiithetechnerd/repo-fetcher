Repo Fetcher
Repo Fetcher is an application developed on the Code.org App Lab platform. It provides a simple interface to interact with GitHub repository data, allowing users to fetch and view repository information directly within a web-based app environment.

Overview
This project was designed as a lightweight tool to bridge the gap between GitHub's repository structure and a mobile-friendly app interface. It demonstrates the use of API requests and data parsing within the App Lab environment.

Features
GitHub API Integration: Fetches real-time data from GitHub.

Repository Analysis: Provides a breakdown of repository files or metadata.

App Lab Interface: User-friendly GUI designed for both desktop and mobile web views.

Clean Data Rendering: Displays fetched code or file lists in a readable format.

How to Use
Since this is an App Lab project, you can run it directly through the Code.org share link or by importing the code into your own App Lab project.

Open the App Lab link for Repo Fetcher.

Enter the GitHub username or the specific repository path in the input field.

Click the Fetch button to retrieve the data.

Use the navigation buttons within the app to browse the fetched content.

Technical Details
